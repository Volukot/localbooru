## FAQ
### Why the copy 
No. The clipboard manager that I use, [pasteboard](https://pub.dev/packages/pasteboard), cannot copy images on mobile devices, only on desktop ones. If anyone has any replacement for it that can actually copy images (i am looking at you [super_clipboard](https://pub.dev/packages/super_clipboard)) for at least any of the mobile platforms I will happily include. For now mobile users are limited to opening and sharing files.  
As the "hotfix" solution for Android users, you can use [an share to clipboard app](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.kpstv.xclipper/)
